# Weather-App

Skills: 💻 JavaScript · 🧱 HTML/CSS · ☁️ API Integration · 🎨 UI/UX Design

For my Computer Science 30 class, I developed a weather app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. I designed a responsive, user-friendly interface with dynamic updates and a location search feature. This project strengthened my skills in frontend development, API integration, and UI design, earning praise for its functionality and clean design. It marked my first hands-on experience in building a practical web app, sparking my passion for web dev and problem-solving through code.
